| Best Practice              | Bootstrap is used for the navbar along with product focus page. The project uses a html5 boilerplate template                                                                                                                                                               |
| Responsive design          | Navbar responds to window size switching to a drop down pain when small enough.

| Advanced Views             | JS is used to validate forms but nothing more. Views are fairly simplistic                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
